The initial momentum of the system in the lab frame is zero (since the equal-mass particles have equal speeds in opposite directions), so the final momentum must also be zero. The photons must have equal wavelengths and must be traveling in opposite directions. Equal  means equal energy, so each photon has energy 149.46 10 J.  (c) IDENTIFY and SET UP: Use Eq.

EXECUTE: (a) One photon dissociates one AgBr molecule, so we need to find the energy required to dissociate a single molecule. The problem states that it requires 51.00 10 J to dissociate one mole of AgBr, and one mole contains Avogadro’s number 23(6.02 10 ) of molecules, so the energy required to dissociate one AgBr is 5 19 23 1.00 10 J/mol 1.66 10 J/molecule. 6.02 10 molecules/mol    The photon is to have this energy, so 19 191.66 10 J(1eV/1.602 10 J) 1.04 eV.E     (b) hc E   so 34 8 6 19 (6.626 10 J s)(2.998 10 m/s) 1.20 10 m 1200 nm 1.66 10 J              hc E (c) cf so 8 14 6 2.998 10 m/s 2.50 10 Hz 1.20 10 m        c f (d) 34 6 26(6.626 10 J s)(100 10 Hz) 6.63 10 J       E hf 26 19 76.63 10 J(1 eV/1.602 10 J) 4.14 10 eV       E (e) EVALUATE: A photon with frequency 100 MHzf has too little energy, by a large factor, to dissociate a AgBr molecule. The photons in the visible light from a firefly do individually have enough energy to dissociate AgBr.
