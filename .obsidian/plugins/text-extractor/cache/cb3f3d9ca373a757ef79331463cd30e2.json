PowerPoint® Lectures for University Physics, Thirteenth Edition – Hugh D. Young and Roger A. Freedman Chapter 41 Atomic Structure Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Goals for Chapter 41 • To see how to write the Schrödinger equation for a three-dimensional problem • To learn how to find the wave functions and energies for a three- dimensional box • To examine the full quantum-mechanical description of the hydrogen atom • To study how an external magnetic field affects the orbital motion of an atom’s electrons • To learn about the intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of the electron • To understand how the exclusion principle affects the structure of many-electron atoms • To study how the x-ray spectra of atoms indicate the structure of these atoms Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. • The Bohr model, in which an atom’s electrons orbit its nucleus like planets around the sun, is inconsistent with the wave nature of matter. A correct treatment uses quantum mechanics and the three- dimensional Schrödinger equation. Introduction • To describe atoms with more than one electron, we also need to understand electron spin and the Pauli exclusion principle. These ideas explain why atoms that differ by just one electron (like lithium with three electrons per atom and helium with two electrons per atom) can be dramatically different in their chemistry.

If a particle of mass m moves in the presence of a potential energy function U(x, y, z), the Schrödinger equation for the particle’s wave function (x, y, z, t) is • This is a direct extension of the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation from Chapter 40.  h 2 2m 2 x, y, z,t  x2  2 x, y, z,t  y2  2 x, y, z,t  z2      U x, y, z  x, y, z,t   ih  x, y, z,t  t Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The Schrödinger equation in 3-D: Stationary states • If a particle of mass m has a definite energy E, its wave function (x, y, z, t) is a product of a time-independent wave function (x, y, z) and a factor that depends on time but not position. Then the probability distribution function |(x, y, z, t)|2 = |(x, y, z)|2 does not depend on time (stationary states). • The function (x, y, z) obeys the time-independent Schrödinger equation in three dimensions:             2222 2 2 2 , , , , , , 2 , , , , , ,           x y z x y z x y z m x y z U x y z x y z E x y z    /, , , , ,  iEtx y z t x y z eCopyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Particle in a three-dimensional box • For a particle enclosed in a cubical box with sides of length L (see Figure 41.2 below), three quantum numbers nX, nY, and nZ label the stationary states (states of definite energy). • The three states shown here are degenerate: Although they have different values of nX, nY, and nZ, they have the same energy E. • Follow Example 41.1. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The hydrogen atom: Quantum numbers • The Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom is best solved using coordinates (r, , ) rather than (x, y, z) (see Figure 41.5 at right). • The stationary states are labeled by three quantum numbers: n (which describes the energy), l (which describes orbital angular momentum), and ml (which describes the z-component of orbital angular momentum). Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The hydrogen atom: Degeneracy • Hydrogen atom states with the same value of n but different values of l and ml are degenerate (have the same energy). • Figure 41.8 (at right) shows the five states with l = 2 and different values of ml. The orbital angular momentum has the same magnitude L for each these five states, but has different values of the z- component Lz. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The hydrogen atom: Quantum states • Table 41.1 (below) summarizes the quantum states of the hydrogen atom. For each value of the quantum number n, there are n possible values of the quantum number l. For each value of l, there are 2l + 1 values of the quantum number ml. • Read Problem-Solving Strategy 41.1, and follow Examples 41.2 and 41.3. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. • States of the hydrogen atom with l = 0 (zero orbital angular momentum) have spherically symmetric wave functions that depend on r but not on  or . These are called s states. Figure 41.9 (below) shows the electron probability distributions for three of these states. • Follow Example 41.4. The hydrogen atom: Probability distributions I Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The hydrogen atom: Probability distributions II • States of the hydrogen atom with nonzero orbital angular momentum, such as p states (l = 1) and d states (l = 2), have wave functions that are not spherically symmetric. Figure 41.10 (below) shows the electron probability distributions for several of these states, as well as for two spherically symmetric s states. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Magnetic moments and the Zeeman effect • Electron states with nonzero orbital angular momentum (l = 1, 2, 3, …) have a magnetic dipole moment due to the electron motion. Hence these states are affected if the atom is placed in a magnetic field. The result, called the Zeeman effect, is a shift in the energy of states with nonzero ml. This is shown in Figure 41.13 (below). • Follow Example 41.5. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The Zeeman effect and selection rules • Figure 41.14 (lower left) shows the shift in energy of the five l = 2 states (each with a different value of ml) as the magnetic field strength is increased. • An atom in a magnetic field can make transitions between different states by emitting or absorbing a photon A transition is allowed if l changes by 1 and ml changes by 0, 1, or –1. (This is because a photon itself carries angular momentum.) A transition is forbidden if it violates these selection rules. See Figure 41.15 (lower right). Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The anomalous Zeeman effect and electron spin • For certain atoms the Zeeman effect does not follow the simple pattern that we have described (see Figure 41.16 below). This is because an electron also has an intrinsic angular momentum, called spin angular momentum. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Electron spin and the Stern-Gerlach experiment • The experiment of Stern and Gerlach demonstrated the existence of electron spin (see Figure 41.17 below). The z-component of the spin angular momentum has only two possible values (corresponding to ms = +1/2 and ms = –1/2). • Follow Examples 41.6 and 41.7. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Quantum states and the Pauli exclusion principle • The allowed quantum numbers for an atomic electron (see Table 41.2 below) are n ≥ 1; 0 ≤ l ≤ n – 1; –l ≤ ml ≤ l; and ms = ±1/2. • The Pauli exclusion principle states that if an atom has more than one electron, no two electrons can have the same set of quantum numbers. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. A multielectron atom • Figure 41.21 (at right) is a sketch of a lithium atom, which has 3 electrons. The allowed electron states are naturally arranged in shells of different size centered on the nucleus. The n = 1 states make up the K shell, the n = 2 states make up the L shell, and so on. • Due to the Pauli exclusion principle, the 1s subshell of the K shell (n = 1, l = 0, ml = 0) can accommodate only two electrons (one with ms = + 1/2, one with ms = –1/2). Hence the third electron goes into the 2s subshell of the L shell (n = 2, l = 0, ml = 0). Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Ground-state electron configurations Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Screening in multielectron atoms • An atom of atomic number Z has a nucleus of charge +Ze and Z electrons of charge –e each. Electrons in outer shells “see” a nucleus of charge +Zeffe, where Zeff < Z, because the nuclear charge is partially “screened” by electrons in the inner shells. • Follow Examples 41.8 and 41.9. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. X-ray spectroscopy • When atoms are bombarded with high-energy electrons, x rays are emitted. There is a continuous spectrum of x rays (described in Chapter 38) as well as strong characteristic x-ray emission at certain definite wavelengths (see the peaks labeled K and K in Figure 41.23 at right). • Atoms of different elements emit characteristic x rays at different frequencies and wavelengths. Hence the characteristic x-ray spectrum of a sample can be used to determine the atomic composition of the sample. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. X-ray spectroscopy: Moseley’s law • Moseley showed that the square root of the x-ray frequency in K emission is proportional to Z – 1, where Z is the atomic number of the atom (see Figure 41.24 below). Larger Z means a higher frequency and more energetic emitted x-ray photons. Follow Example 41.10. • This is consistent with our model of multielectron atoms. Bombarding an atom with a high-energy electron can knock an atomic electron out of the innermost K shell. K x rays are produced when an electron from the L shell falls into the K-shell vacancy. The energy of an electron in each shell depends on Z, so the x-ray energy released does as well. • The same principle applies to K emission (in which an electron falls from the M shell to the K shell) and K emission (in which an electron falls from the N shell to the K shell).","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
