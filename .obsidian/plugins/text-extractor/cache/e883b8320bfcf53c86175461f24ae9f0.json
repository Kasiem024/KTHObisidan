PowerPoint® Lectures for University Physics, Thirteenth Edition – Hugh D. Young and Roger A. Freedman Chapter 38 Photons: Light Waves Behaving as Particles Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Goals for Chapter 38 • To consider the fundamental constituent of light, the photon • To study the removal of an electron by an incident photon, the photoelectric effect • To understand how the photon concept explains x-ray production, x-ray scattering, and pair production • To interpret light diffraction and interference in the photon picture • To introduce the Heisenberg uncertainty principle Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Introduction • Until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, light was well understood as an electromagnetic wave. • When Einstein and others published work on the photoelectric effect, scientists began to understand light also as a discrete unit, the photon. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The photoelectric effect • Blue light striking cesium causes the cesium to emit electrons. Red light does not. • Einstein’s explanation: Light comes in photons. To emit an electron, the cesium atom must absorb a single photon whose energy exceeds the ionization energy of the outermost electron in cesium. A blue photon has enough energy; a red photon does not. • Refer to Figure 38.3 at right. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric effect • A photon contains a discrete amount of energy. For light of frequency f and wavelength , this energy is E = hf or E = (hc)/ , where h is Planck’s constant 6.626 × 10−34 J • s. • This explains how the energy of an emitted electron in the photoelectric effect depends on the frequency of light used (see Figure 38.6 to the right). • The momentum of a photon of wavelength  is p = h/.

The photoelectric effect—examples • Read the Problem-Solving Strategy 38.1. • Follow Example 38.1—Laser-pointer photons. • Follow Example 38.2—A photoelectric-effect experiment. • Follow Example 38.3—Determining  and h experimentally. • Refer to Table 38.1 below.

The greater the kinetic energy of the electrons that strike the anode, the shorter the minimum wavelength of the x rays emitted by the anode (see Figure 38.8 at lower right). • The photon model explains this behavior: Higher-energy electrons can convert their energy into higher-energy photons, which have a shorter wavelength (see Example 38.4). Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. X-ray scattering: The Compton experiment • In the Compton experiment, x rays are scattered from electrons. The scattered x rays have a longer wavelength than the incident x rays, and the scattered wavelength depends on the scattering angle . • Explanation: When an incident photon collides with an electron, it transfers some of its energy to the electron. The scattered photon has less energy and a longer wavelength than the incident photon (see Figure 38.10 right). Follow Example 38.5. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Pair production • When gamma rays of sufficiently short wavelength are fired into a metal plate, they can convert into an electron and a positron (positively-charged electron), each of mass m and rest energy mc2. • The photon model explains this: The photon wavelength must be so short that the photon energy is at least 2mc2. Follow Example 38.6. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Diffraction and uncertainty • When a photon passes through a narrow slit, its momentum becomes uncertain and the photon can deflect to either side (see Figure 38.17 below). A diffraction pattern is the result of many photons hitting the screen. The pattern appears even if only one photon is present at a time in the experiment. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle • You cannot simultaneously know the position and momentum of a photon with arbitrarily great precision. The better you know the value of one quantity, the less well you know the value of the other (see Figure 38.18). • In addition, the better you know the energy of a photon, the less well you know when you will observe it. • Follow Example 38.7.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
