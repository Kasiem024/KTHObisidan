PowerPoint® Lectures for University Physics, Thirteenth Edition – Hugh D. Young and Roger A. Freedman Chapter 39 Particles Behaving as Waves Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Goals for Chapter 39 • To study the wave nature of electrons • To examine the evidence for the nuclear model of the atom • To understand the ideas of atomic energy levels and the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom • To learn the fundamental physics of how lasers operate • To see how the ideas of photons and atomic energy levels explain the continuous spectrum of light emitted by a blackbody • To see how the Heisenberg uncertainty principle applies to the behavior of particles Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Introduction • At the end of the 19th century light was regarded as a wave and matter as a collection of particles. Just as light was found to have particle characteristics (photons), matter proved to have wave characteristics. • The wave nature of matter allows us to use electrons to make images (such as the one shown here of viruses on a bacterium). Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. De Broglie waves • The physicist de Broglie hypothesized that the relationships E = hf = hc/ and p = h/ for photons also apply to electrons. Thus electrons should have wave characteristics. • The de Broglie hypothesis was confirmed by the discovery that electrons undergo diffraction, just like x rays do (see Figure 39.4). • Read Problem-Solving Strategy 39.1. • Follow Example 39.1—An electron-diffraction experiment. • Follow Example 39.2— Energy of a thermal neutron. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Electron microscopy • The wave aspect of electrons means that they can be used to form images, just as light waves can. This is the basic idea of the electron microscope (see Figure 39.5 at right). • Follow Example 39.3—An electron microscope. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Atomic line spectra • If a sample of a certain element is sealed in a glass tube and heated to form a hot gas, the light emitted by atoms in the sample includes only certain discrete wavelengths. The spectrum of this light (“line spectrum”) is different for different elements. Nineteenth-century physics could not explain this. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The nuclear atom • Rutherford probed the structure of the atom by sending alpha particles at a thin gold foil. Some alpha particles were scattering by large angles, leading him to conclude that the atom’s positive charge is concentrated in a nucleus at its center. • Refer to Figures 39.11 (below) and 39.12 (right) and then follow Example 39.4. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The failure of classical physics • Rutherford’s experiment suggested that electrons orbit around the nucleus like a miniature solar system. However, classical physics predicts that an orbiting electron would emit electromagnetic radiation and fall into the nucleus (see Figure 39.14). So classical physics could not explain why atoms are stable. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Atomic energy levels • Niels Bohr explained atomic line spectra and the stability of atoms by postulating that atoms can only be in certain discrete energy levels. When an atom makes a transition from one energy level to a lower level, it emits a photon whose energy equals that lost by the atom (see Figure 39.16 at lower left). • An atom can also absorb a photon, provided the photon energy equals the difference between two energy levels (see Figure 39.17 at lower right). Follow Example 39.5. Insert Figure 39.16 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The Bohr model of hydrogen • Bohr explained the line spectrum of hydrogen (see Figure 39.25 below) with a model in which the single hydrogen electron can only be in certain definite orbits. • In the nth allowed orbit, the electron has orbital angular momentum nh/2 (see Figure 39.21 at right). Follow Example 39.6. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Hydrogen spectrum in more detail • The line spectrum at the bottom of the previous slide is not the entire spectrum of hydrogen; it’s just the visible-light portion. • Hydrogen also has series of spectral lines in the infrared and the ultraviolet. See Figure 39.24 below. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Hydrogen-like atoms • The Bohr model can be applied to any atom with a single electron. This includes hydrogen (H) and singly-ionized helium (He+). See Figure 39.27 below. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The laser • Atoms spontaneously emit photons of frequency f when they transition from an excited energy level to a lower level. Excited atoms can be stimulated to emit coherently if they are illuminated with light of the same frequency f. This happens in a laser (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation). See Figure 39.28. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Continuous spectra and blackbody radiation • A blackbody is an idealized case of a hot, dense object. Figure 39.32 (at right) shows the continuous spectrum produced by a blackbody at different temperatures. • Classical physics could not explain the shape of the blackbody spectrum. Planck provided an explanation by assuming that atoms in the blackbody have evenly-spaced energy levels, and emit photons by jumping from one energy level down to the next one. • Follow Example 39.7—Light from the sun. • Follow Example 39.8—A slice of sunlight.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle revisited • The Heisenberg uncertainty principle for momentum and position applies to electrons and other matter, as does the uncertainty principle for energy and time. This gives insight into two-slit interference with electrons (see Figure 39.34 below). • Follow Example 39.9—The uncertainty principle: position and momentum. • Follow Example 39.10—The uncertainty principle: energy and time.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
