IDENTIFY and SET UP: By momentum conservation the two photons must have equal and opposite momenta. Then Epc says the photons must have equal energies. Their total energy must equal the rest mass energy 2Emc of the pion. Once we have found the photon energy we can use Ehf to calculate the photon frequency and use /cf  to calculate the wavelength. EXECUTE: The mass of the pion is e270 ,m so the rest energy of the pion is 270(0 511 MeV) 138 MeV. Each photon has half this energy, or 69 MeV. 619 22 34 (69 10 eV)(1 602 10 J/eV) so 1 7 10 Hz 6 626 10 J s E Ehf f h            8 14 22 2 998 10 m/s 18 10 m 18 fm. 17 10 Hz c f         EVALUATE: These photons are in the gamma ray part of the electromagnetic spectrum. 44.5.

IDENTIFY: With a stationary target, only part of the initial kinetic energy of the moving proton is available. Momentum conservation tells us that there must be nonzero momentum after the collision, which means that there must also be leftover kinetic energy. Therefore not all of the initial energy is available. SET UP: The available energy is given by 22 2 a 2( )mEmc E mc for two particles of equal mass when one is initially stationary. The minimum available energy must be equal to the rest mass energies of the products, which in this case is two protons, a K and a K .  The available energy must be at least the sum of the final rest masses. 44-4 Chapter 44 © Copyright 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.
