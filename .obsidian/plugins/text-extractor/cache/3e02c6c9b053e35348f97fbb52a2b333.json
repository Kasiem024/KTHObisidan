PowerPoint® Lectures for University Physics, Thirteenth Edition – Hugh D. Young and Roger A. Freedman Lectures by Wayne Anderson Chapter 43 Nuclear Physics Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Goals for Chapter 43 • To understand some key properties of nuclei • To see how nuclear binding energy depends on the number of protons and neutrons • To investigate radioactive decay • To learn about hazards and medical uses of radiation • To analyze nuclear reactions • To investigate nuclear fission • To understand the nuclear reactions in our sun Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Introduction • How can we date ancient biological artifacts? • Most of the mass of an atom is found in its tiny nucleus. • Some nuclei are stable, but others spontaneously decay. • Fission and fusion are important nuclear reactions. We would not exist without the fusion in our sun. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Properties of nuclei • The nucleon number A is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. • The radius of most nuclei is given by R = R0A1/3. • All nuclei have approximately the same density. • Follow Example 43.1. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Nuclides and isotopes • The atomic number Z is the number of protons in the nucleus. The neutron number N is the number of neutrons in the nucleus. Therefore A = Z + N. • A nuclide is a single nuclear species having specific values for both Z and N. • The isotopes of an element have different numbers of neutrons. • Follow the text discussion of nuclear spin and magnetic moments. • Follow Example 43.2 on proton spin flips. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. NMR and MRI • Follow the text discussion of nuclear magnetic resonance and MRI, using Figure 43.1 below. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Nuclear binding energy • The binding energy EB of a nucleus is the energy that must be added to separate the nucleons. • Follow the text discussion of nuclear binding energy, using Figure 43.2 (right). • Read Problem-Solving Strategy 43.1. • Follow Example 43.3 on strongly bound nuclei. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The nuclear force • The nuclear force binds protons and neutrons together. It is an example of the strong interaction. • Important characteristics of the nuclear force:  It does not depend on charge. Protons and neutrons are bound. It has a short range, of the order of nuclear dimensions.  Because of its short range, a nucleon only interacts with those in its immediate vicinity.  It favors binding of pairs of protons or neutrons with opposite spins and with pairs of pairs (a pair of protons and a pair of neutrons, each pair having opposite spins).

Nuclear models • Follow text discussion of the liquid-drop model and the shell model. • Figure 43.3 (right) shows the approximate potential-energy functions for a nucleon in a nucleus. • Follow Example 43.4. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Nuclear stability and radioactivity • Radioactivity is the decay of unstable nuclides by the emission of particles and electromagnetic radiation. • Figure 43.4 (right) is a Segrè chart showing N versus Z for stable nuclides. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Alpha decay • An alpha particle  is a 4He nucleus. • Figure 43.5 shows the alpha decay of the 226Ra nuclide. • Follow Example 43.5. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Beta and gamma decay • There are three types of beta decay: beta-minus, beta-plus, and electron capture. • A beta-minus – particle is an electron. • A gamma ray is a photon. • Follow the text discussion of beta decay and gamma decay. • Follow Example 43.6 on cobalt-60. • Follow Example 43.7 on cobalt-57. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Natural radioactivity • Figure 43.7 (right) shows a Segrè chart for the 238U decay series. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Activities and half-lives • The half-life is the time for the number of radioactive nuclei to decrease to one-half of their original number. • The number of remaining nuclei decreases exponentially (see Figure 43.8 at right). • Follow the text discussion of decay rates and radioactive dating. • Follow Example 43.8 on 57Co activity. • Follow Example 43.9 on radio- carbon dating. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Biological effects of radiation • Follow the text discussion of the biological effects of radiation. • Table 43.3 gives the RBE for several types of radiation. • Figure 43.9 shows sources of U.S. radiation exposure. • Follow Example 43.10 about a medical x ray. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Nuclear reactions • A nuclear reaction is a rearrangement of nuclear components due to bombardment by a particle rather than a spontaneous natural process. • The difference in masses before and after the reaction corresponds to the reaction energy Q. • Follow Example 43.11, which looks at exoergic and endoergic reactions. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Nuclear fission • Nuclear fission is a decay process in which an unstable nucleus splits into two fragments (the fission fragments) of comparable mass. • Figure 43.11 (right) shows the mass distribution of the fission fragments from the fission of 236U*. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Liquid-drop model • The liquid-drop model helps explain fission. See Figure 43.12 below. • Figure 43.13 (right) shows the potential energy function of two fission fragments. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Chain reactions • The neutrons released by fission can cause a chain reaction (see Figure 43.14 below). Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Nuclear reactors • A nuclear reactor is a system in which a controlled nuclear chain reaction is used to liberate energy. • Figure 43.15 below illustrates a nuclear power plant. • Follow Example 43.12. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Nuclear fusion • In a nuclear fusion reaction, two or more light nuclei fuse to form a larger nucleus. • Figure 43.16 below illustrates the proton-proton chain, which is the main energy source in our sun. • Follow Example 43.13.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
