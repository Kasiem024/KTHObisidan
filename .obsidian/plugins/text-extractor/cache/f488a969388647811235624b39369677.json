PowerPoint® Lectures for University Physics, Thirteenth Edition – Hugh D. Young and Roger A. Freedman Chapter 40 Quantum Mechanics Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Goals for Chapter 40 • To introduce and interpret the Schrödinger wave equation for quantum-mechanical waves • To solve the Schrödinger equation for a one-dimensional “particle in a box” • To study the behavior of a quantum-mechanical particle in a finite potential well • To examine tunneling, in which quantum mechanics allows a particle to travel through a region that would be forbidden by Newtonian physics • To consider the quantum-mechanical harmonic oscillator, a model for molecular vibrations Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Introduction • Just as we use the wave equation to analyze waves on a string or sound waves in a pipe, we can use a related equation—the Schrödinger equation—to analyze the behavior of matter from a quantum-mechanical perspective. • Microscopic beads of different sizes fluoresce under ultraviolet light (see the figure at right); the smaller the beads, the shorter the wavelength of visible light they emit. The Schrödinger equation will help us understand why. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The Schrödinger equation in 1-D • In a one-dimensional model, a quantum-mechanical particle is described by a wave function (x, t). • The one-dimensional Schrödinger equation for a free particle of mass m is • The presence of i (the square root of –1) in the Schrödinger equation means that wave functions are always complex functions. • The square of the absolute value of the wave function, |(x, t)|2, is called the probability distribution function. It tells us about the probability of finding the particle near position x at time t.  h 2 2m 2 x,t  x2  ih  x,t  t Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The Schrödinger equation in 1-D: A free particle • If a free particle has definite momentum p and definite energy E, its wave function (see Figure 40.3 at right) is • Such a particle is not localized at all: The wave function extends to infinity.  x,t  Ae ikxeit where p  hk and E  h. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The Schrödinger equation in 1-D: Wave packets • A free-particle wave packet (see Figure 40.6 at right) is a superposition of states of definite momentum and energy. • To make the wave packet more localized in space, the greater the range of momenta and energies it must include. • Follow Example 40.1. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The Schrödinger equation in 1-D: Stationary states • If a particle of mass m moves in the presence of a potential energy function U(x), the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation for the particle is • If the particle has a definite energy E, the wave function (x, t) is a product of a time-independent wave function (x) and a factor that depends on time t but not position. For such a stationary state the probability distribution function |(x, t)|2 = |(x)|2 does not depend on time. • The time-independent one-dimensional Schrödinger equation for a stationary state of energy E is • Follow Example 40.2.         22 2 ,, , 2         x t x t U x x t i m x t    /,   iEtx t x e         22 22     dx U x x E x m dx Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Particle in a box • A “particle in a box” is a particle of mass m confined to a region between x = 0 and x = L (see Figure 40.8 at lower left). The potential energy is zero inside the “box” and infinite outside (see Figure 40.9 at lower right). Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Particle in a box: Wave functions, energy levels • Figure 40.11 (below) illustrates the energy levels and associated stationary-state wave functions (x) for a particle in a box. • Follow Example 40.3. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Particle in a box: Probability and normalization • Figure 40.12 at right shows the first three stationary-state wave functions (x) for a particle in a box (top) and the associated probability distribution functions |(x)|2 (bottom). There are locations where there is zero probability of finding the particle. • Wave functions must be normalized so that the integral of |(x)|2 over all x equals 1 (which means there is 100% probability of finding the particle somewhere). • Follow Example 40.4. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Particle in a finite potential well I • A finite potential well is a region where potential energy U(x) is lower than outside the well, but U(x) is not infinite outside the well (see Figure 40.13 below). • In Newtonian physics, a particle whose energy E is less than the “height” of the well can never escape the well. In quantum mechanics the wave function of such a particle extends beyond the well, so it is possible to find the particle outside the well. • Follow Example 40.5. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Particle in a finite potential well II • Figure 40.15 (below left) shows the stationary-state wave functions (x) and corresponding energies for one particular finite well. • Figure 40.16 (below right) shows the corresponding probability distribution functions |(x)|2. • Follow Example 40.6. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Potential barriers and tunneling • Figure 40.19 (below left) shows a potential barrier. In Newtonian physics, a particle whose energy E is less than the barrier height U0 cannot pass from the left-hand side of the barrier to the right-hand side. • Figure 40.20 (below right) shows the wave function (x) for such a particle. The wave function is nonzero to the right of the barrier, so it is possible for the particle to “tunnel” from the left-hand side to the right-hand side. • Follow Example 40.7. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Applications of tunneling • A scanning tunneling microscope measures the atomic topography of a surface. It does this by measuring the current of electrons tunneling between the surface and a probe with a sharp tip (see Figure 40.21 below). • An alpha particle inside an unstable nucleus can only escape via tunneling (see Figure 40.22 at right). Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. A comparison of Newtonian and quantum oscillators • Figure 40.26 (below, top) shows the first four stationary-state wave functions (x) for the harmonic oscillator. A is the amplitude of oscillation in Newtonian physics. • Figure 40.27 (below, bottom) shows the corresponding probability distribution functions |(x)|2. The blue curves are the Newtonian probability distributions.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
