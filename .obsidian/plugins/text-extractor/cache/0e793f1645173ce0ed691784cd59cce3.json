PowerPoint® Lectures for University Physics, Thirteenth Edition – Hugh D. Young and Roger A. Freedman Lectures by Wayne Anderson Chapter 42 Molecules and Condensed Matter Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Goals for Chapter 42 • To understand the bonds holding atoms together • To see how rotation and vibration of molecules affect spectra • To learn how and why atoms form crystalline structures • To apply the energy-band concept to solids • To develop a model for the physical properties of metals • To learn how impurities affect semiconductors and to see applications for semiconductors • To investigate superconductivity Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Introduction • Why do CO2 molecules raise the temperature of Venus so high? Why are they raising the earth’s temperature? • After looking at individual atoms in earlier chapters, we shall now look at molecules and condensed matter, formed when atoms combine. • We’ll see how energy bands help us understand solids and we’ll look at semiconductors, which are used in calculators, computers, and much more.

Ionic bonds • An ionic bond is an interaction between oppositely charged ionized atoms. • Figure 37.1 (right) shows a graph of the potential energy of two oppositely charged ions. • Follow Example 42.1. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Covalent bonds • In a covalent bond, the wave functions are distorted and become more concentrated in certain places. • Figure 42.2 (right) shows the hydrogen covalent bond, and Figure 42.3 (below) shows the methane molecule.

Rotational energy levels • Follow the text discussion of rotational energy levels for diatomic molecules. • Figure 42.4 (left) shows a model of a diatomic molecule. • Figure 42.5 (right) shows some rotational energy levels for a diatomic molecule. • Follow Example 42.2. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Vibrational energy levels • Follow the text discussion of vibrational energy levels of a diatomic molecule. • Figure 42.6 (left) shows a model of a diatomic molecule. • Figure 42.7 (right) shows some vibrational energy levels of a diatomic molecule. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Rotation and vibration combined • Follow the text discussion. Figure 42.8 (right) shows an energy-level diagram for rotational and vibrational energy levels of a diatomic molecule. Figure 42.9 (below) shows a typical molecular band spectrum. • Follow Example 42.3. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Crystal lattices • A crystal lattice is a repeating pattern of mathematical points. Figure 42.11 (below) shows some common types of lattices. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Crystal lattices and structures • Follow the text discussion of crystal lattices and structures using Figures 42.12 (top) and 42.13 (bottom). Figure 42.14 (below) shows diamond. • Follow Example 42.4. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Types of crystals • Follow the text discussion of the types of crystals. • Figure 42.15 (left) shows a metallic solid, and Figure 42.16 (right) shows an edge dislocation in two dimensions. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Energy bands • Follow the text analysis, using Figures 42.18 (right) and 42.19 (below). • Follow Example 42.5. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Free-electron model of metals • The free-electron model assumes that electrons are completely free inside the metal, but that there are infinite potential-energy barriers at the surface. • The density of states, dn/dE, is the number of states per unit energy range. • Follow the text analysis using Figures 42.20 (left) and 42.21 (right). Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Fermi-Dirac distribution • The Fermi-Dirac distribution f(E) is the probably that a state with energy E is occupied by an electron. • Follow the analysis of the Fermi-Dirac distribution in the text, using Figures 42.22 (top) and 42.23 (bottom). • Follow Example 42.6. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Electron concentration and free-electron energy • Follow the text analysis of electron concentration and Fermi energy. • Follow Example 42.7 on the Fermi energy in copper. • Follow the text analysis of the average free- electron energy. • Follow Example 42.8 which compares a free- electron gas with an ideal gas. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Semiconductors • A semiconductor has an electrical resistivity that is intermediate between those of good conductors and good insulators. • Follow Example 42.9 using Figure 42.24 below. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Holes • A hole is a vacancy in a semiconductor. • A hole in the valence band behaves like a positively charged particle. • Figure 42.25 at the right shows the motions of electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band with an applied electric field. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Impurities • Doping is the deliberate addition of impurity elements. • In an n-type semiconductor, the conductivity is due mostly to negative charge (electron) motion. • In a p-type semiconductor, the conductivity is due mostly to positive charge (hole) motion. • Follow the text analysis of impurities. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. n-type and p-type semiconductors • Figure 42.26 (left) shows an n-type semiconductor, and Figure 42.27 (right) shows a p-type semiconductor. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Photocell • A photocell is a simple semiconductor device. • See Figure 42.28 below. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The p-n junction • A p-n junction is the boundary in a semiconductor between a region containing p-type impurities and another region containing n-type impurities. • Figure 42.29 below shows the behavior of a semiconductor p-n junction in a circuit. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Currents through a p-n junction • Follow the text analysis of currents through a p-n junction. • Figure 42.30 below shows a p-n junction in equilibrium.
