PowerPoint® Lectures for University Physics, Thirteenth Edition – Hugh D. Young and Roger A. Freedman Lectures by Wayne Anderson Chapter 37 Relativity Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Goals for Chapter 37 • To understand the two postulates of relativity and their motivation • To see why two observers can disagree on simultaneity • To learn why moving clocks run slow • To see how motion affects length • To understand why velocity depends on the frame of reference • To calculate relativistic momentum and kinetic energy • To explore the key concepts of general relativity Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Introduction • How do particles behave if they reach 99.995% the speed of light? • What are the basic postulates behind special relativity? • We shall see some of the far- reaching implications of relativity, such as the effect of motion on time and length. • We’ll see that momentum and kinetic energy must be redefined. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Einstein’s first postulate • Einstein’s first postulate, known as the principle of relativity, states that the laws of physics are the same in every inertial reference frame. (See Figure 37.1 below.) Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Einstein’s second postulate • Einstein’s second postulate is that the speed of light in vacuum is the same in all inertial frames of reference and is independent of the motion of the source. (See Figure 37.2 below.) • The second postulate implies that it is impossible for an inertial observer to travel at the speed of light in vacuum. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The Galilean transformation • The Galilean transformation is a transformation between two inertial frames of reference. • Follow the text discussion of the Galilean transformation. Use Figure 37.3 at the right, in which the position of particle P is described in two frames of reference. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. A thought experiment in simultaneity • Follow the text discussion of a thought experiment in simultaneity using Figure 37.5 (right). Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Relativity of time intervals • The two observers (Mavis and Stanley) measure different time intervals due to their relative motion. (See Figure 37.6 below.) • Follow the text discussion of the relativity of time intervals and time dilation. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Proper time • Proper time is the time interval between two events that occur at the same point. • A frame of reference can be pictured as a coordinate system with a grid of synchronized clocks, as in Figure 37.9 at the right. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Examples of time dilation • Read Problem-Solving Strategy 37.1. • Follow Example 37.1 on time dilation at high speed. • Follow Example 37.2 on time dilation at airliner speeds. • Follow Example 37.3 on proper time. • Follow the text discussion on the twin paradox. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Relativity of length • Follow the text discussion of length contraction. • In Figure 37.10 below, the length of the ruler is measured by two observers moving relative to each other. • The proper length is the length measured in the frame at which a body is at rest. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Lengths perpendicular to the direction of motion • There is no length contraction for lengths perpendicular to the direction of relative motion. See Figure 37.12 below. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Examples of length contraction • Follow Problem-Solving Strategy 37.2. • Follow Example 37.4 using Figure 37.13 below. • Follow Example 37.5. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The Lorentz transformations • The Lorentz transformations relate the coordinates and velocities in two inertial reference frames. They are more general than the Galilean transformations and are consistent with the principle of relativity. • Follow the text derivation of the coordinate and velocity transformations, using Figure 37.15 at the right. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Examples using the Lorentz transformations • Read Problem-Solving Strategy 37.3. • Follow Example 37.6. • Follow Example 37.7 using Figure 37.16 below. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Doppler effect for electromagnetic waves • Follow the text derivation using Figure 37.17 below. • Follow Example 37.8 illustrated by Figure 37.19 at the right. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Relativistic momentum • Follow the text discussion of relativistic momentum. • Figure 37.20 at the right shows a graph of the momentum of a particle as a function of its speed. Notice that the momentum approaches infinity as the speed approaches the speed of light. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Newton’s second law and relativistic mass • Follow the text discussion of Newton’s second law and relativistic mass. • The relativistic mass is mrel = m. • Follow Example 37.9 which looks at the relativistic dynamics of an electron. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Relativistic work and energy • The relativistic kinetic energy is K = ( – 1)mc2. The graph in Figure 37.21 (right) shows the kinetic energy as a function of speed. Note that the kinetic energy approaches infinity as the speed approaches the speed of light. • The rest energy is mc2. • The total energy of a particle is E = K + mc2 = mc2. • The total energy, rest energy, and momentum are related by E2 = (mc2)2 + (pc)2. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Examples of relativistic energy • Follow Example 37.10 dealing with energetic electrons. • Follow Example 37.11 which looks at a collision. Use Figure 37.22 below. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. General relativity • In Figure 37.23 at the right, the astronaut cannot distinguish the effects of uniform gravity from the effects of uniform acceleration. • Follow the text discussion of the general theory of relativity.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
