PowerPoint® Lectures for University Physics, Thirteenth Edition – Hugh D. Young and Roger A. Freedman Lectures by Wayne Anderson Chapter 44 Particle Physics and Cosmology Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Goals for Chapter 44 • To learn the key varieties of fundamental particles • To see how accelerators and detectors are used to investigate subatomic particles • To learn how subatomic particles interact with each other • To understand how quarks explain the structure of many subatomic particles • To learn how we probe the standard model of particles and interactions • To investigate the Big Bang and the expansion of the universe Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Introduction • How much of the universe is composed of “normal” matter? • What is the world ultimately made of? • The physics on the microscopic scale is essential to understand the universe on its largest scale. • We’ll conclude with the evolution of the universe. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. A history of fundamental particles • Follow the text discussion of the electron, proton, photon, neutron, and positron. • Figure 44.1 (right) shows the first known positron track. • Figure 44.2 (below) deals with Dirac’s prediction of the positron. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Pair production • The positron is the antiparticle of the electron. • Figure 44.3 (right) shows pair production of electron-positron pairs. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Particles as force mediators • Follow the text discussion of force mediators and mesons. • Figure 44.4 (right) shows an analogy for how particles act as force mediators. • Figure 44.5 (below) shows the Yukawa potential-energy function. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Particle accelerators and detectors • Follow the text discussion of particle accelerators and detectors. • Figure 44.6 below shows the layout and operation of a cyclotron. • Follow Examples 44.1, 44.2, and 44.3. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Particles and interactions • The four fundamental interactions (forces) are:  the strong interaction  the electromagnetic interaction  the weak interaction  the gravitational interaction. • Table 44.1 summarizes characteristics of these interactions. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Leptons • Leptons do not experience the strong interaction. • Table 44.2 summarizes the characteristics of the six leptons. • Follow Example 44.4. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Hadrons • Hadrons experience the strong interaction. • Mesons and baryons are subclasses of hadrons. • Table 44.3 (next slide) shows some hadrons and their properties. • The total baryon number is conserved in all interactions. • Follow the text discussion of hadrons, strangeness, and conservation laws. • Follow Example 44.5. • Follow Example 44.6. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Some hadrons and their properties Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Quarks • Hadrons are composed of quarks. • Figure 44.10 (right) shows the quark content of four different hadrons. • Follow the discussion of the three original quarks. • Follow Example 44.7. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The eightfold way • Follow the text on motivating the quark model and the eightfold way, using Figures 44.11 (top) and 44.12 (bottom). Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The standard model • Follow the text discussion of color and three more quarks using Figure 44.13 (right). • Table 44.5 (next slide) summarizes quark properties. • Follow the text discussion of the standard model and beyond. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Properties of the six quarks Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The expanding universe • There is a red shift in the light from distant galaxies. • Hubble’s law: The recession speed of a galaxy is proportional to its distance r from us: v = H0r. • The graph in Figure 44.16 (right) illustrates Hubble’s law. • Follow Example 44.8. • Follow Example 44.9. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The Big Bang • Hubble’s law suggests that at one time all the matter in the universe was extremely concentrated and was then blown apart by the Big Bang. • The red shift of galaxies is caused by the expansion of space itself. We live in an expanding universe. • Figure 44.17 (right) shows an analogy for the expanding universe. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The future of the universe • If the average density of the universe is less than the critical density, the universe should expand forever. If it is greater, the universe should stop expanding and then contract. (See Figure 44.18 at the right.) • Most of the matter in the universe is mysterious nonluminous dark matter. • Invisible dark energy seems to be causing the expansion of the universe to speed up. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. The beginning of time • The early universe was extremely dense and hot. • Follow the text discussion of temperatures, uncoupling of interactions, and the standard model of the history of the universe, using Figure 44.20 below. • Follow Example 44.10 on temperature and energy. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Nucleosynthesis • Follow the text discussion of nucleosynthesis. • Figure 44.21 (right) shows the Veil Nebula, a supernova remnant. • Follow Conceptual Example 44.11. Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education Inc. Background radiation • Follow the text discussion of the background radiation. Refer to Figure 44.22 below. • Follow the text discussion of matter and antimatter. • Follow Example 44.12 on the expansion of the universe.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
